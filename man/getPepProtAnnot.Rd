\title{Creating an annotation data.frame with important peptide and protein
features.}
\usage{
getPepProtAnnot(reportOut, reportOut2=NULL, quantName, pepName,
protName, isTryptic, startPosition, allProtName=NULL, NMissedCleavages=NULL,
isProteotypic=NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{reportOut}{MS report as data.frame or matrix including sample and
quantity information, e.g. Spectronaut report.
The MS report has to include the following columns:
\itemize{
  \item names/identifiers of the quantity to be analyzes (e.g. peptide,
  modified peptide, precursor)
  \item the peptide names (i.e., AS sequence). This may be identical to the
  names/identifiers of the quantity to be analyzed.
  \item the matching protein names
  \item the information the peptide is full- or half-tryptic
  \item the start position of the peptide in the protein sequence
}
Optional columns to include are:
\itemize{
  \item all proteins matching the sequence
  \item number of missed cleavages
  \item proteotypic state
  }}

\item{reportOut2}{Optional additional MS report as data.frame or matrix
including sample and quantity information, e.g. Spectronaut report.
\code{reportOut2} should contain the same columns as \code{reportOut}. If
\code{reportOut2} is added, the peptide & protein annotation file will also
include quantities uniquely measured in \code{reportOut}. Default is 'NULL',
assuming only one MS report being presented.}

\item{quantName}{A character string or numeric giving the column name or
column number in which the row names of value used in the quantity matrices
are provided. This  These variable should be identical to the
\code{quantName} provided in \code{extractMSData} and therefore match the
row.names of the LiP and/or TrP data matrices.}

\item{pepName}{A character string or numeric giving the column name or
column number in which peptide names (i.e., AA sequences) are provided.}

\item{protName}{A character string or numeric giving the column name or
column number in which protein names are provided. If a peptides matches to
the same protein several times, the protein name should be provided each
time, separated by ','. If a peptide maps to the multiple proteins, these
different proteins can be provided by separating them by ';'.}

\item{isTryptic}{A character string or numeric giving the column name or
column number in which annotation of the digest type are provided.}

\item{startPosition}{A character string or numeric giving the column name or
column number in which start position from each peptide in its protein
sequence are provided. If a peptides matches to the same protein several
times, different start positions should be separated by ','. If a peptide
maps to the multiple proteins, the start positions should be separated
with ';'.}

\item{allProtName}{A character string or numeric giving the column name or
column number in which all protein names mapping to a peptide sequence are
provided. If a peptides matches to the same protein several times, the
protein name should be provided each time, separated by ','. If a peptide
maps to the multiple proteins, these different proteins can be provided by
separating them by ';'.}

\item{NMissedCleavages}{A character string or numeric giving the column name
or column number in which number of missed cleavages in each peptide are
provided.}

\item{isProteotypic}{A character string or numeric giving the column name or
column number in which annotation of the peptide is proteotypic are provided.}
}
\value{
Returns a data.frame including all necessary annotation on peptides
(/modified peptides/precursors) and the matching proteins.
}
\description{
Create an annotation data.frame for the quantities from a MS
report/MS reports. This annotation file is needed for further downstream
analysis and provides a structured overview about peptide and protein
features.
