runModel(quantityList, annotS=NULL, formulaRUV="Y~XPep+XProt",

\arguments{
\item{quantityList}{A list of preprocessed matrices, containing quantities of
interest(e.g. peptide, modified peptide, precursor) and protein abundances.
Rows represent features and columns samples and should match between the
different matrices contained in the list.
Output from \code{preprocessQuantityMatrix} is in the correct format.
The matrices of \code{quantityList} may have the following names
\itemize{
  \item c('LiPPep', 'TrPPep', 'TrPProt')
  \item c('LiPPep', 'TrPPep')
  \item c('LiPPep', 'TrPProt')
  \item c('LiPPep', 'LiPProt')
  or use the variable naming 'Y', 'XPep' and 'XProt'.
  }}

\item{annotS}{A data.frame containing sample annotation. Rows are samples and
must match to columns of the matrices in \code{quantityList}. Must include
columns of any further variables used in \code{formulaRUV} and
\code{formulaContrast}.}

\item{formulaRUV}{A character string or formula defining the RUV models
performing bounded variable least square regression. Use 'Y' for defining the
quantity matrix with values to predict. If additional quantity matrices
should be used as variables in the models, please refer to these as 'XPep'
and/or 'XProt'. All other variables in the formula should refer to columns in
\code{annotS}. If RUV should not be run, set to 'NULL'.
Default is 'Y~XPep+XProt'.}

\item{formulaContrast}{A character string or formula defining the contrast
models performing ordinary variable least square models. Use 'Y' for defining
the quantity matrix with values to predict. Â´If additional quantity matrices
should be used as variables in the models, please refer to these as 'XPep'
and/or 'XProt'. All other variables in the formula should refer to columns in
\code{annotS}.If contrast models should not be run, set to 'NULL'. If set to
'NULL', the residuals of the RUV models will additionally be returned.
Default is Y~Condition'.}

\item{lowRUV}{A numeric vector defining lower boundaries of the coefficients
of the RUV models. Elements refer to definition of \code{formulaRUV}.
Default is defined as 'c(-Inf, 0, 0)'.}

\item{upRUV}{A numeric vector defining upper boundaries of the coefficients
of the RUV models. Elements refer to definition of \code{formulaRUV}.
Default is defined as 'c(Inf, Inf, Inf)'.}

\item{addRUVbounds}{A boolean value, if set to 'TRUE' as many bounds as
additionally needed based on \code{formulaRUV} in each RUV model are added to
\code{lowRUV} and \code{upRUV}. Added boundaries are automatically set to
\code{lowRUV = -Inf} and \code{upRUV = Inf}. Important to set to 'TRUE', if
you have categories with multiple levels in the RUV model and did not adjust
the RUV boundaries based in the number of levels. This might be the case if
you have more than two batches you aim to account for in the RUV model.
Default is 'FALSE'.}

\item{returnRUVmodels}{A boolean value, set to 'TRUE' the function will
additionally return all RUV models.
Default is 'FALSE'.}

\item{returnContrastmodels}{A boolean value, set to 'TRUE' the function will
additionally return all contrast models
Default is 'FALSE'.}
}
\value{
If a contrast model is run, a list of two data.frames will be
returned. The first contains the model coefficients of all models, the second
provides the p-values estimated in the contrast model. If a RUV model is run
before the contrast model, a third data.frame containing the RUV residuals
is provided in the returned list. If only RUV is run, it will return a list
of two data.frame, the first containing the residuals of the RUV model, the
second one provides the coefficients from the model. If
\code{returnContrastmodels} and/or \code{returnRUVmodels} is set to 'TRUE',
the RUV and/or contrast models for each peptide will be exported as
additional list element(s).
