\title{Combining protein names of identical peptides in the peptide and
protein annotation data.frame.}
\usage{
joinPG(annotPP, iCol, protCol = "Protein")
}
\arguments{
\item{annotPP}{A data.frame with peptide and protein annotation were rows are
features. The data.frame must include a column with the identifiers for the
quantity of interest, which should be unique after this function is run, e.g.
peptide, modified peptide or precursor ID. It must additionally include a
column providing the matching protein names. Protein names for the same
peptide should be separated by ',' if a peptide maps to the same protein
multiple times and ';' if a peptide maps to multiple proteins.}

\item{iCol}{A character string or numeric giving the column name or
column number containing the identifiers for the quantity of interest.}

\item{protCol}{A character string or numeric giving the column name or
column number in which protein names  are provide. If a peptides matches to
the same protein several times, the protein name should be provided each
time, separated by ','. If a peptide maps to the multiple proteins, these
different proteins can be provided by separating them by ';'.
Default is 'Protein'.}
}
\value{
A data.frame were the chosen quantity of interest, e.g. peptide,
modified peptide or precursor ID, is unique.
}
\description{
Joining protein names together in the respective column in the
peptide and protein annotation data.frame in cases were a peptide was matched
to different PG groups in different MS reports. Only relevant if two MS
reports are used to create the annotation data.frame.
