\title{Creates data.frame with sample annotation from MS report}
\usage{
getSampleAnnot(reportOut, sampleName="R.FileName",
sampleCondition="R.Condition", typeCondition="categorical",
contrastCoding="dummyCoding", baseLevel=NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{reportOut}{MS report as data.frame or matrix including sample names and
condition of interest. Per default, a Spectronaut report exported using the
Spectronaut schema 'SpectroSchema_LiPAnalyzerOut' is expected. If outer MS
report formats are provided, please alter the input variables
\code{sampleName} and \code{sampleCondition} accordingly.}

\item{sampleName}{A character string or numeric giving the column name or
column number providing the sample names in the MS report.
Default is 'R.FileName'.}

\item{sampleCondition}{A character string or numeric giving the column name
or column number providing sample conditions in the MS report.
Default is 'R.Condition'.}

\item{typeCondition}{A character string providing information if
\code{sampleCondition} is  'categorical' or 'continuous'. If condition is
'continuous', the column containing the condition in the MS report has to be
numeric. If the condition is a 'categorical', contrast coding for later
models is defined within this function.
Default is 'categorical'.}

\item{contrastCoding}{A character string providing information which type of
contrast coding to use if \code{typeCondition} is 'categorical'. Can be set
to dummyCoding', 'sumCoding' or 'wecCoding'. If you do not want to define
the contrast coding method within this function set to NULL and subsequently
define it before running the contrast model.
Default is 'dummyCoding'.}

\item{baseLevel}{A character strong giving name of reference level if
\code{typeCondition} is a categorical variable. If not provided the function
will choose the first occurring condition in the MS report as the reference
level.}
}
\value{
Returns a data.frame containing sample and condition annotation were
rows are samples.
}
\description{
Create an annotation file on samples including information on
the conditions of samples. This function only runs, if all the annotations
were added to the MS report, else please create the sample annotation file
yourself. The file should include all variables which should be used in the
LiPAnalyzeR models. Rows should be samples, with row names having the
matching row.names to the column names in the quantity matrices. Columns
should contain the necessary sample information, for example a 'Condition'
column providing the sample-specific condition or a 'Batch' column.
